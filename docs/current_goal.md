# Current Goal: Code & Syntax Cleanup

These are the steps I plan to take
to clean up some base syntax and code:

1. Look over code for further cleanup opportunities

2. Item reference syntax cleanup; esp using tokens

3. Use `parse_string` in implementation of `combined_rule`

4. Allow blank lines in code

5. Be able to refer to `item?` as `item`

6. Try to move `parse_info` out of `parse.py`

7. Set `run._state` from only one Python module

8. Make debug-friendly flags command-line usable


## Notes

*(I can add notes here if anything comes up while working on this goal.)*
