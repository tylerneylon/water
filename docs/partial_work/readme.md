# Partial Work

This directory is for work that I'm not yet ready to throw away, but
I'm not currently using.

## `parse-with-parser.py`

This contains a very partial implementation of a `Parser` class that
could possibly one day support `loadstring`- or `exec`-like behavior.
One day that behavior will be critical, but for now I'm still not certain
of the best way to implement it.
