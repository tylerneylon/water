# Project Water

The goal of water is to build a dynamic compiler, which is explained below.
The project is at a very early stage, and the current code is a rough
prototype of a language parser.

## Primary Goal

Let language designers and programmers focus on language, and ignore the
details of building parsers, compilers, optimizers, interpreters, and
debuggers.
